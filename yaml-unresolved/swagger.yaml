    <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
    <p>The Schenker Logistics Rest-API provide an interface to Schenker Logistics Warehouse Management System (WMS) operations.</p>
    <h2>SCOPE</h2>
    <p>This API covers the following scopes in the business processes of the WMS</p>
    <h3>Master Data</h3>
    <p>Master data holds information that supports the warehouse operations. The master data endpoints are used to send product information, vendor information that is needed to enable the warehouse to receive and send goods.</p>
    <h3>Inventory Management</h3>
    <p>The Inventory Management API provides the customer with the current inventory levels and status to enable inventory reconciliation.</p>
    <h3>Outbound</h3>
    <p>Also known as a sales order, pick ticket or stock transfer order. The Outbound Logistics Order is used as a request from the customer to the warehouse to pick/pack and dispatch goods.</p>
    <h3>Inbound</h3>
    <p>Also known as Advance Shipping Notification (ASN), purchase order, goods receipt and return notification or shipment / delivery advice. The Inbound Logistics Order notifies the warehouse that a stock replenishment delivery is scheduled or is on its way to the warehouse.</p>
    <h3>Returns</h3>
    <p>The Return Order deals with customer returns/an order that describes inventory that has been returned to the warehouse from a customer.</p>
    <h2>USING THE API</h2>
    <p>WMS-specific implementation guidelines are available for each of the warehouse systems that support the Warehouse Management API. Please contact your local/regional DSC Business Unit IT lead at DSC to obtain a copy.</p>

    <p>The API is accessed as REST API using OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization and JSON format for request and response messages.  The API uses HTTPS (over SSL) protocol.</p> 
    <h2>EXAMPLE USE CASES</h2>
    <p>Schenker logistics customers which would like to integrate their systems using standard APIs.</p>
